## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: For the website structure.
- **CSS3**: For styling (via `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: For interactivity (via `main.js`).
- **Remixicon**: For icons (version 4.3.0, via `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@4.3.0/fonts/remixicon.css`).
- **Swiper**: For the testimonial slider (version 11, via `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css` and `.js`).
- **ScrollReveal**: For scroll-based animations (via `https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal`).

## File Structure
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the website structure.
- `styles.css`: Custom CSS for styling the website.
- `main.js`: JavaScript file for handling interactivity, animations, and Swiper functionality.
- `assets/`: Directory containing images used across the website (e.g., `header.jpg`, `about.png`, `product-1.png`, `user-1.jpg`, etc.).

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone or Download**: Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. **Open `index.html`**: Use a web browser to open the `index.html` file or serve it via a local server (e.g., using `Live Server` in VS Code).
3. **Dependencies**:
   - The website uses external CDNs for Remixicon, Swiper, and ScrollReveal. Ensure an internet connection to load these resources, or host them locally if needed.
   - Remixicon: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/remixicon@4.3.0/fonts/remixicon.css`
   - Swiper CSS: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.css`
   - Swiper JS: `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/swiper@11/swiper-bundle.min.js`
   - ScrollReveal: `https://unpkg.com/scrollreveal`
4. **Assets**: Ensure the `assets/` directory is in the same directory as `index.html` to load images correctly.

## Usage
- Navigate using the top navigation bar or the mobile menu (accessible via the hamburger icon).
- Use the search bar to find specific products.
- Explore the Products section to view furniture items and their prices.
- Check the Deals section for special offers and the Testimonials section for customer reviews.
- Use the footer links to access additional resources, support, or social media pages.

## Notes
- The website assumes the presence of a `styles.css` file for styling and a `main.js` file for JavaScript functionality, including Swiper initialization. Ensure these files are properly linked and implemented.
- Image paths in the `assets/` directory must match the referenced filenames in `index.html`.
- The search bar is a placeholder and requires backend integration for full functionality.
